# Disaster Recovery Analysis

This document analyzes various failure scenarios for PostgreSQL systems and evaluates the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) achievable with the pg_tools restoration suite.

## Key Definitions

- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: Maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. How much data can you afford to lose?
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: Maximum acceptable time to restore service after a failure. How long can you be down?

## Failure Scenarios

### 1. Corrupted Database Files

**Likelihood**: Medium (2-3%)

**Description**: Data corruption in PostgreSQL data files due to hardware failure, filesystem corruption, or software bugs.

**Symptoms**:
- PostgreSQL refusing to start
- Error messages about corrupted pages
- Checksum failures in logs
- Inconsistent query results

**RPO with Current Setup**:
- **Best case**: Last pgbackrest incremental backup (typically 5-15 minutes)
- **Worst case**: Last pgbackrest full backup plus WAL archives
- **Typical**: 5-30 minutes depending on backup schedule

**RTO with Current Setup**:
- **Estimation**: 15-60 minutes
- **Breakdown**:
  - Detect corruption: 5-15 minutes
  - Identify recovery point: 2-5 minutes
  - Run restore_pg.sh: 10-45 minutes (depends on database size)
  - Verify restoration: 5-10 minutes

**Additional Considerations**:
- Keep multiple backup retention periods to recover from delayed-detection corruption
- Monitor PostgreSQL checksums (`data_checksums = on`)
- Implement automated corruption detection (pg_checksums, amcheck extension)
- Consider point-in-time recovery to just before corruption occurred
- Test restoration speed with production-sized datasets
- Ensure pgbackrest repository is on separate storage from database

### 2. Accidental Data Deletion or Modification

**Likelihood**: Medium-High (5-10%)

**Description**: User error, application bug, or malicious action causes unwanted data changes (DROP TABLE, UPDATE without WHERE, etc.).

**Symptoms**:
- Missing tables or rows
- Incorrect data values
- User reports of data loss
- Application errors due to missing data

**RPO with Current Setup**:
- **Best case**: Minutes (can restore to exact time before the mistake)
- **Typical**: 1-5 minutes (time to identify exact timestamp)
- **Critical advantage**: Point-in-time recovery allows restoration to specific timestamp

**RTO with Current Setup**:
- **Estimation**: 20-90 minutes
- **Breakdown**:
  - Detect issue: 5-30 minutes (varies greatly)
  - Identify exact timestamp: 5-15 minutes (requires investigation)
  - Run restore_pg.sh: 10-45 minutes
  - Extract needed data: 5-15 minutes (may need to copy specific tables)
  - Verify and merge data: 10-30 minutes

**Additional Considerations**:
- Maintain detailed application logs with timestamps for correlation
- Implement row-level audit logging for critical tables
- Consider logical replication to a delayed standby (30-60 minute delay)
- Use database roles and permissions to limit destructive operations
- Implement application-level soft deletes for critical data
- Keep transaction logs to identify exact timestamp of bad changes
- May need to restore to parallel cluster and selectively copy data back
- Consider pgAudit extension for detailed audit trails

- Unauthorized data deletion
- Suspicious administrative actions in logs

**RPO with Current Setup**:
- **Best case**: Minutes before attack (if detected quickly)
- **Worst case**: Hours or days (if attack went undetected)
- **Critical**: Depends entirely on when attack started, not when detected

**RTO with Current Setup**:
- **Estimation**: 2-8 hours
- **Breakdown**:
  - Detect attack: Varies (minutes to days)
  - Contain and isolate: 30-60 minutes
  - Verify backup integrity: 30-90 minutes (critical!)

  - Diagnose storage issue: 15-30 minutes
  - Provision replacement storage: 30-90 minutes
  - Configure new storage: 15-30 minutes
  - Run restore_pg.sh: 10-45 minutes
  - Verify restoration: 10-20 minutes

**Additional Considerations**:
- **Critical**: pgbackrest repository MUST be on different storage
- Use different storage backend for backups (local disks, different SAN, cloud)
- Monitor storage health metrics (SMART, array controller status)
- Implement storage redundancy (RAID, replicated SANs)
- Test failover to alternate storage
- Keep recent backups on local disks as well as remote storage
- Document storage dependencies and single points of failure
- Maintain relationship with storage vendor for rapid support
- Consider multi-cloud or hybrid storage strategy

### 6. Software Bug or Failed Upgrade

**Likelihood**: Low (1-2%)

**Description**: PostgreSQL upgrade introduces bugs, corrupts data, or causes instability.

**Symptoms**:
- Unexpected behavior after upgrade
- Performance degradation
- Data inconsistencies
- Application errors

**RPO with Current Setup**:
- **Best case**: 0 minutes (restore to just before upgrade)
- **Ideal**: Should have backup immediately before upgrade
- **Typical**: Can restore to exact pre-upgrade state

**RTO with Current Setup**:
- **Estimation**: 30-90 minutes
- **Breakdown**:
  - Identify need to rollback: 10-30 minutes
  - Run restore to pre-upgrade time: 15-45 minutes
  - Verify rollback: 10-20 minutes

1. **Increase backup frequency**: More frequent incremental backups
2. **Implement WAL archiving**: Continuous backup of transaction logs
3. **Use streaming replication**: Real-time standby with ~0 RPO
4. **Enable pgbackrest parallel processing**: Faster backups mean more frequent backups

### Improve RTO

1. **Maintain hot standby**: Streaming replication for instant failover
2. **Automate detection**: Monitoring and alerting to reduce detection time
3. **Pre-stage recovery hardware**: Keep spare servers ready
4. **Automate restoration**: Scripts and orchestration tools
5. **Regular DR drills**: Practice reduces actual recovery time
6. **Document everything**: Runbooks, network diagrams, credentials vault
7. **Use faster storage**: SSD/NVMe for backup repository

### Critical Infrastructure Requirements

1. **Geographic separation**: Backups in different physical location
2. **Immutable backups**: Protection against ransomware
3. **Multiple backup generations**: 30-90 day retention minimum
4. **Automated monitoring**: Backup success/failure alerts
5. **Regular restore testing**: Monthly verification of backup integrity
6. **Configuration versioning**: Git repository for /etc (already implemented!)
7. **Documentation accessibility**: DR plans accessible outside primary infrastructure

### Testing Schedule

- **Weekly**: Verify backup completion and logs
- **Monthly**: Test single table/database restore
- **Quarterly**: Full server restoration test
- **Annually**: Complete DR site failover drill
- **After any infrastructure change**: Verify backup and restore still work

## Cost vs. Risk Trade-offs

### Low-Cost Improvements

- Increase pgbackrest backup frequency (compute cost only)
- Implement automated backup verification scripts
- Better documentation and runbooks
- Regular DR drills (time investment)

### Medium-Cost Improvements

- PostgreSQL streaming replication to hot standby
- Off-site backup repository (cloud storage)
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- Spare hardware for faster recovery

### High-Cost Improvements

- Geographic redundancy with active-active setup
- Full DR datacenter with real-time replication
- Dedicated security operations center (SOC)
- Enterprise support contracts

## Conclusion

The current pg_tools setup provides **solid RPO (5-30 minutes) and RTO (15-90 minutes)** for most failure scenarios, particularly when combined with:

1. Properly configured pgbackrest with frequent incrementals
2. Git-versioned configuration management
3. Documented procedures

**Critical gaps to address**:

1. **Geographic separation**: Ensure pgbackrest repository is off-site
2. **Ransomware protection**: Implement immutable backups
3. **Hot standby**: Consider streaming replication for critical systems
4. **Automation**: Reduce manual steps in recovery process
5. **Regular testing**: Verify recovery procedures work under pressure

The biggest risk is not tool limitations but **operational discipline**: taking regular backups, testing restoration, maintaining documentation, and practicing recovery procedures.
